AI-GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE
===============================================================================

Significant portions of this repository — including code, architecture
decisions, documentation, and configuration — were generated or co-authored
with the assistance of AI language models, primarily Anthropic's Claude
(claude-sonnet-4-6).

This includes but is not limited to:

  - All scraper modules (scrapers/)
  - Processing pipeline modules (processing/)
  - pipeline.py orchestration logic
  - .gitignore, requirements.txt, and this NOTICE file
  - README.md structure and content
  - License selection rationale

AI-generated code has been reviewed by the repository author but may contain
errors, suboptimal patterns, or suggestions that require validation before
use in production environments. Users should independently verify correctness,
particularly for:

  - Revit API usage patterns
  - Rate limiting and terms-of-service compliance for scraped sources
  - Fine-tuning hyperparameters and hardware compatibility

===============================================================================
